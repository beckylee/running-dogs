OMFGDOGS!

by Beckylee Dell

1. Background implemented no problem without flash.  Song changed from 
   the original OMFGDOGS song to Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up."
   I added solid backgrounds behind the links because it was too hard to
   see otherwise.  Also, I included a link so that Rick Astley gets credit
   for his work as well.

2. My friend Michelle inspired me to Rick Roll you and the idea was
   confirmed by a number of your previous students.

3. Spent about 2 hours on the project.
